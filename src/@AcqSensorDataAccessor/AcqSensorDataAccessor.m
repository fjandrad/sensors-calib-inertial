classdef AcqSensorDataAccessor < handle
    %AcqSensorDataAccessor Retrieves the path to acquired data for its use in a calibrator
    %   We assume that the sensors of a given modality, from a given set of
    %   parts, are being calibrated and data from those sensors have been
    %   stored as N data sets through N acquisition sequences (MotionSequencer runner
    %   sequences). This class stores the sequences information required
    %   by the calibrators. For each sensor modality, 'getFolderPaths()'
    %   returns the list of data set folders and respective calibrated
    %   parts.
